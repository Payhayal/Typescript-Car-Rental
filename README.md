# Libraries

- React: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of their applications efficiently.

- React Router DOM: React Router DOM is a routing library for React applications. It enables developers to create dynamic, client-side routing in their single-page applications, allowing for navigation between different views or pages without a full page refresh.

- TypeScript: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. It helps developers catch errors early in the development process and write more maintainable code by providing features such as type checking, interfaces, and advanced tooling support.

- React Select: React Select is a customizable and accessible dropdown/select component for React applications. It provides features like async loading, filtering, and the ability to render options as components, making it a popular choice for handling user selections in forms.

- Framer Motion: Framer Motion is a library for creating fluid animations and gestures in React applications. It offers a simple and declarative API for animating React components, allowing developers to create rich and interactive user experiences with ease.

- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed utility classes for building responsive and customizable user interfaces. It enables developers to quickly create stylish designs without having to write custom CSS from scratch.

- Axios: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous HTTP requests in JavaScript and Node.js applications. It provides an easy-to-use API for sending HTTP requests and handling responses, supporting features like interceptors, request cancellation, and automatic JSON parsing.
